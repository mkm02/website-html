        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello World! This is my third year at BYU studying Computer Science,
           as you probably already guessed. I am originally from a town called
           Parker, CO. My beautiful wife, Cinthya, and I have been married for
           about 2 years now, and we absolutely love it!
        </p>
        <p>
          A little bit more about me, I love a whole variety of things. I am a
           big Star Wars and superhero fan. I love movies and video games and
           spending time with family. I also enjoy visiting new places and trying
           new activities. The mountains and the beach each have a place in my
           heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          One last thing, I'm also a huge dork. I love making people laugh, but
           you'll probably also facepalm when you're around me!
